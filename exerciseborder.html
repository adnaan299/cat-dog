    <p>Quick Tips About Persian Cats
        Here are more tips to help keep your Persian cat in top shape:

        Persian cats can have excessive tearing, which can cause staining.
        It’s important to wipe under their eyes each day with a cotton ball or soft cloth to help avoid black or
        brown smudges from forming.
        All cats need to have annual check-ups. This can help your veterinarian detect health issues in the early
        stages when they can be easier to treat.
        Need a veterinarian for your cat? Use our Vet Finder to locate one in your area.
        Be sure to brush their teeth regularly and schedule an annual cleaning at your veterinarian’s office.
        Unhealthy teeth and gums can lead to big problems, like infections that can affect the heart.
        Provide your cat with interactive toys to help them get exercise and avoid boredom. Persians are notoriously
        laid back, but a little catnip or catnip-filled toy can help get them moving.
        Is your Persian cat scratching the furniture? Put out a safe and sturdy scratching post. If your cat isn’t
        interested in the post, spray it with some catnip, which you can buy in liquid form online or from a local
        pet store.</p>

        <h1>I am Dog</h1>

    <p>The dog (Canis familiaris[4][5] or Canis lupus familiaris[5]) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also
        called the domestic dog, it is derived from an ancient, extinct wolf,[6][7] and the modern wolf is the dog's
        nearest living relative.[8] The dog was the first species to be domesticated,[9][8] by hunter-gatherers over
        15,000 years ago,[7] before the development of agriculture.[1] Due to their long association with humans, dogs
        have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals[10] and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich
        diet that would be inadequate for other canids.[11]

        The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical
        attributes.[12] Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for humans, such as
        hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and
        aiding disabled people. Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the human-canine
        bond has been a topic of frequent study.[13] This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of
        "man's best friend".[14]</p>
